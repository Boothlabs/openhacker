	<li>Penetration Testing</li>
		<p>Users are allowed to attempt to find vulnerabilities in the game where rewards will be determined by the severity of the bug. As a note: using automated tools is prohibited simply due to the large amount of traffic they generate. (We follow Google's rules for vulnerability discovery/disclosure and rewards (Minus the monentary part, although users can request funds added to their in-game bank account). Check <a style="color:cyan;"href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/">here</a> for more information from Google. If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact staff members (even if your just letting us know you're performing tests.)</p>

<h4>Who made this game?</h4>
	<p>This game was created by Francis Booth as a fork off of an old game created in High School.</p>
	
<h4>Will there be new features?</h4>
	<p>Yes! New features and questions are added regularly, maintenance periods will be the time where new features will be added but users will be alerted of their timings beforehand to minimize inconvenience. Most updates are applied seamlessly and require no unnecessary downtime, if an update causes issue with the game the update will be rolled back.</p>
	
<h4>Can I contibute to the game?</h4>
	<p>Currently I am not looking for extra help in developing the game. However when staffing needs permit I will open up the possibility for users to be promoted to a moderator rank where they will be responsible for keeping the community in check.</p>
	
<h4>What happens when a user becomes a moderator/admin?</h4>
	<p>A user is first invited to join The Equation Group (Administrative Clan in the game) and once they have accepted their user role will automatically raise to Moderator (Unless a direct promotion to admin has been agreed upon by the staff). The user will then have access to all the tools necessary to perform their duties.</p>
	
<h4>What does the Game Administration do?</h4>
	<p>The Game Administration group (known in-game as The Equation Group) is responsible for handling tickets, adding game content, and managing the status quo of the game. <b>Asking to be part of the team will only reduce your chances of being selected.</b> Players who are selected are people we find to be very helpful and overall an important member of the community.</p>
	
<h4>Can I report admin abuse?</h4>
	<p>Absolutely! If you feel you were treated unfairly by a member of the Administration team, Speak up! The admins of the game are here to make sure everyone has a good time. If your claim leads to a demotion you will be awarded for helping our community stay corruption free. Tolerance for such actions are zero and depending on the severity will end ether from a simple demotion to completely being kicked out from the game.</p>
	
<h4>Can I contact you personally?</h4>
	<p>Sure thing, Most of the time I am busy but I make sure to answer all emails sent to me so if you have something you wish to ask, have a question that wasn't answered in this FAQ, even if its unrelated to the game itself, feel free to email me <a style="color:cyan !important;" href="mailto:boothf@boothlabs.me">here</a> and I will try to get back to you within 24-48 hours (1-2 days).</p>
